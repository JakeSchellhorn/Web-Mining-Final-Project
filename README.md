## MLB data collection and Visualization

In this project I wanted to use the techniques I learned in my web mining class and implement them into the world of sports. I started by finding a python wrapper for  Major League Baseball stats api. By making calls to the api I took data from before the pitch clock was implemented and after. The data I used was batting averages of the league leaders and the timings of events during the games. I then created visualizations of the data to determine what effect the pitch clock had on the game of baseball.
